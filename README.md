**Introduction**
hii there, i am Ishan Mehra and i am from Punjab, India which is a renowned state there. I am 22 and if i talk about my hobbies, i love art and craft and in that, i love making miniatures specifically. Another hobby that i really enjoy is smartphone film-making, i don't know that when i got interested in this field, however i remember that i loved making short clips in my childhood and i am following the same till now. all i can say is that this activity provides me immense joy. Turning towards my family, there are 6 of us, my parents, my grandma and we are three siblings. i have two elder sisters. the agenda of my life is to become UX and UI designer. I also have many short term goals such as working experience in a restaurant, having a photoshoot of my own for a magazine, making a movie by my own. So, this is what i would say here about me.
