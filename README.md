**Introduction**
hii there,I am Ishan Mehra and I am from Punjab, India which is a renowned state there. I am 22 and if I talk about my hobbies, I love art and craft and in that, I love making miniatures specifically. Another hobby that I really enjoy is smartphone film-making, I don't know that when I got interested in this field, however I remember that I loved making short clips in my childhood and I am following the same till now. All I can say is that this activity provides me immense joy. Turning towards my family, there are 6 of us, my parents, my grandma and we are three siblings. I have two elder sisters. the agenda of my life is to become UX and UI designer. I also have many short term goals such as working experience in a restaurant, having a photoshoot of my own for a magazine, making a movie by my own. So, this is what I would say here about me.

1.Love Art and Craft
